# API-a-go-go
The APIs that I used do not require a key. I used the following APIS:
 1. [Sunrise Sunset] (https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) to retrieve information on when the sunrise, sunset and how long the day will be in Seattle.
 2. [People in Space] (http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) to retrieve information on who is in space and which craft they are in.

 ## Used the following tools
 1. [LatLong] (https://www.latlong.net/place/seattle-wa-usa-2655.html) to know longitude and latitude coordinates for a particluar place.
